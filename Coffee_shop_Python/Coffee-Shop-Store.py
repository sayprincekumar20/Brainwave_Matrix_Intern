shop_data.columns


# The dataset we are working with contains the following columns:
# 1. transaction_id: A unique identifier for each transaction, typically used to distinguish between different sales or transactions. This is usually an alphanumeric or numeric code.
#       
#       
#   2.  transaction_date: The date when the transaction occurred. This would typically be in a YYYY-MM-DD format or any other standard date format. It records the specific day of the sale.
# 
# 3.  transaction_time: The time when the transaction occurred, typically in HH:MM:SS format. This column tracks the exact time of day when the transaction was made.
# 
# 4.  store_id: A unique identifier for the store where the transaction took place. This helps to track which store processed the transaction, especially useful in multi-store setups.
# 
# 5. store_location: This column provides information about the geographical location of the store, such as the city, region, or address. It helps understand where the sale took place geographically.
# 
# 6. product_id: A unique identifier for each product sold during the transaction. It can be a numeric or alphanumeric code, used to reference specific products in the inventory.
# 
# 7. transaction_qty: The quantity of the product sold during the transaction. This shows how many units of a particular product were sold in a single transaction.
# 
# 8. unit_price: The price per unit of the product at the time of the transaction. This indicates the selling price of one unit of the product.
# 
# 9. product_category: A broad category that groups similar products together. For example, in a coffee shop, categories might include Beverages, Snacks, or Bakery Items.
# 
# 10. product_type: A more specific classification within the product_category. For instance, under the Beverages category, the product_type could be Coffee, Tea, or Juice.
# 
# 11. product_detail: Additional information about the product, such as a detailed description. It could include product features like flavors, variations, or special ingredients.
# 
# 12. Size: The size of the product, especially relevant for products like beverages or clothing. For example, in a coffee shop, Size might refer to Small, Medium, or Large cups.
# 
# 13. Total_bill: The total amount billed for the transaction. This is the sum of the cost of all products sold in the transaction, typically calculated as transaction_qty * unit_price (before taxes or discounts).
# 
# 14. Month Name: The name of the month during which the transaction took place (e.g., January, February). It provides a readable format of the month extracted from the transaction_date.
# 
# 15. Day Name: The name of the day on which the transaction occurred (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). This is often derived from the transaction_date and helps analyze sales trends by days of the week.
# 
# 16. Hour: The hour when the transaction occurred, extracted from the transaction_time column. This helps in understanding the time-of-day patterns in sales (e.g., peak sales hours).
# 
# 17. Day of Week: A numeric value representing the day of the week when the transaction occurred (e.g., 1 for Monday, 7 for Sunday). This is useful for analyzing data programmatically.
# 
# 18. Month:A numeric representation of the month in which the transaction took place (e.g., 1 for January, 12 for December). This is a simplified version of the Month Name column for easier sorting and calculations.

# # Understand the Data Types:
# 1.  Numeric Columns: transaction_qty, unit_price, Total_bill, Hour, Day of Week, Month
# 2. Categorical Columns: store_id, store_location, product_category, product_type, product_detail, Size, Month Name, Day Name
# 3.  Date/Time Columns: transaction_date, transaction_time
# 4. Identifiers: transaction_id, product_id

# # Statistical Summary of Numeric Columns:
#         Use describe() to get a statisticsl summary(mean, median, min,max,quartiles) for the numeric columns

# In[49]:


shop_data[['transaction_qty','unit_price','Total_bill','Hour','Day of Week','Month']].describe()


#  Key Insights:
# 1.    Most transactions involve small quantities (1 or 2 items), and the average price per item is affordable, with the majority priced around 3.00.
# 2.   Sales occur most frequently around midday, with peak activity between 9 AM and 3 PM.
# 3. Transactions are fairly distributed across different days of the week and the first half of the year.

# 1. How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?
# 
# Weâ€™ll use a heatmap to visualize the variation in sales by day of the week and hour of the day.

# In[46]:


import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Group data by day of the week and hour, summing the total bill
sales_by_day_hour = shop_data.groupby(['Day of Week', 'Hour'])['Total_bill'].sum().reset_index()

# Pivot for the heatmap (correct syntax using keyword arguments)
sales_pivot = sales_by_day_hour.pivot(index='Day of Week', columns='Hour', values='Total_bill')

# Create a list to map day numbers to names if 'Day of Week' is numeric (e.g., 0 = Sunday)
day_labels = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday']

# Plot heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.heatmap(sales_pivot, cmap='Blues', annot=True, fmt=".1f", cbar_kws={'label': 'Total Sales ($)'}, vmin=0, vmax=sales_pivot.max().max())

# Set the title and axis labels
plt.title('Sales by Day of the Week and Hour of the Day', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Hour of the Day', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Day of the Week', fontsize=12)

# Use the day labels if needed
plt.yticks(ticks=range(len(day_labels)), labels=day_labels, rotation=0)

# Show the heatmap
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()


# Key Insights:
# 
# 1.Peak Sales Hours:
# 
# * Morning Peaks: The heatmap likely shows high sales volumes in the morning, particularly between 7 AM and 11 AM. This suggests that your business experiences a strong customer influx during these hours.
# 
# *   Afternoon and Evening Trends: Sales may show a dip or continue to be moderate after the peak morning hours, with another possible peak in the early evening.
# 
# 2.Day of the Week Patterns:
# 
# *   Weekday vs. Weekend: Sales patterns may differ between weekdays and weekends. For instance, you might observe higher sales on weekends or specific days, indicating popular shopping days.
# 
# *   Consistency: Some days might exhibit more consistent sales throughout the day compared to others, helping you understand which days are less variable in terms of sales.
# 
# 3.Low Sales Periods:
# 
#   * Late Hours Decline: Sales are likely to decline sharply after certain hours, such as after 10 AM or in the late evening (7 PM onwards). This information can help in optimizing staff schedules and store hours.
# 
# 4.High Sales Correlation:
# 
# * Hourly Correlation: If certain hours across different days consistently show higher sales, it could suggest specific times when promotions or marketing efforts are particularly effective.
# 
# 5.Anomalies or Outliers:
# 
# * Unexpected Trends: Look for any anomalies or outliers in the heatmap where sales might be unexpectedly high or low. This could indicate special events, promotions, or other factors influencing sales.
# 
# 6.Operational Adjustments:
# 
# * Staffing and Inventory: Use these insights to adjust staffing levels and inventory management according to peak and off-peak hours. For example, ensuring more staff during peak hours can enhance customer service and efficiency.

# 2.Are there any peak times for sales activity?
# 
# To visualize peak times, we can plot the total sales for each hour of the day.

# In[47]:


# Group sales by hour
sales_by_hour = shop_data.groupby('Hour')['Total_bill'].sum().reset_index()

# Plot sales by hour
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Hour', y='Total_bill', data=sales_by_hour, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Total Sales by Hour of the Day')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales')
plt.xlabel('Hour of the Day')
plt.show()


# * Peak Hours: If the plot shows a significant increase in total sales between 7 AM and 11 AM, it indicates that this is a key time for sales activity. Your business may experience high customer traffic during these hours.
# * Low Sales: If sales are consistently low early in the late at night, you might consider adjusting store hours or implementing strategies to increase customer engagement during these times.

# 3. What is the total sales revenue for each month?
# * Weâ€™ll use a bar chart to show the total sales revenue for each month.

# In[52]:


import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Group sales by month name
sales_by_month = shop_data.groupby('Month Name')['Total_bill'].sum().reset_index()

# Sort month order if needed
month_order = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']
sales_by_month['Month Name'] = pd.Categorical(sales_by_month['Month Name'], categories=month_order, ordered=True)
sales_by_month = sales_by_month.sort_values('Month Name')

# Calculate growth percentage month by month
sales_by_month['Growth Percentage'] = sales_by_month['Total_bill'].pct_change() * 100

# Plot total sales by month
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 6))

# Plot sales by month
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.barplot(x='Month Name', y='Total_bill', data=sales_by_month, palette='coolwarm')
plt.title('Total Sales Revenue by Month')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)

# Plot growth percentage

plt.show()


#    * Positive Growth Trend: The plot showing continuous growth from January to June suggests a strong positive trend. This could indicate successful business operations, effective marketing strategies, or increased customer demand.
#   * Further Analysis: To fully understand this trend, you might consider analyzing factors such as specific marketing activities, product launches, and customer feedback during these months.
#   
# Overall, the continuous growth trend is a positive indicator of your businessâ€™s performance and can help guide future strategies to sustain and enhance this upward trajectory.

# 4.How do sales vary across different store locations?
# 
#     Here, weâ€™ll use a bar chart to show sales per store location.

print(f"The Order per Person in the Coffee Shop: ${order_per_person:.2f}")




# 6. Which products are the best selling in terms of quantity and revenue?
# 
#        We can use bar charts to display both best-selling products by quantity and revenue.

# In[56]:


# Group by product_id and sum the quantities sold
best_selling_qty = shop_data.groupby('product_id')['transaction_qty'].sum().reset_index().sort_values(by='transaction_qty', ascending=False).head(5)
